### üìù Overview

Phase-field (PF) modeling is a powerful method to simulate microstructure evolution in additive manufacturing, but its high computational cost limits large-scale simulations. This work introduces a machine learning (ML) surrogate model using a 3D U-Net architecture, trained on small-scale PF simulations, to predict grain orientations at high accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost.
